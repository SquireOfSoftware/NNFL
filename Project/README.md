Created a README file to track my thoughts.

I have moved things around into the oldTinkeringCode for any pieces of code that I have messed around with and tested.

Note that one of the things that I have changed is the extraction process and I try and include the rawData with the processed data unlike the previous group which just had two large lump data files which was quite difficult to interpret

The major changes is that I am purely recording the x, y, z coordinates rather than including the velocity and direction with the code, though in the future we may need them hence the recordings that I make now should be extensible at the very least.

The challenge now is trying to figure out how all three of us can make 300 recordings "easily". I say easily because at the moment, it can only do one recording easily.
